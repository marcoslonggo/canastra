# üÉè Buraco/Canastra Implementation TODO

## **Phase 1: Core Rule Engine Foundation** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## **Testing Scenarios** üß™

### **Wildcard Testing**
- [ ] A‚ô†-2‚ô†-3‚ô†-4‚ô†-Joker (same-suit 2 + Joker = allowed)
- [ ] A‚ô†-2‚ô•-3‚ô†-4‚ô†-Joker (different-suit 2 + Joker = not allowed)
- [ ] A‚ô†-2‚ô†-3‚ô†-4‚ô†-5‚ô†-6‚ô†-7‚ô† (same-suit natural 2 = Limpa)
- [ ] A‚ô†-2‚ô•-3‚ô†-4‚ô†-5‚ô†-6‚ô†-7‚ô† (different-suit 2 = Suja)

### **Three Aces Testing**
- [ ] A‚ô†-A‚ô•-Joker (2 natural + 1 wild = valid)
- [ ] A‚ô†-2‚ô•-Joker (1 natural + 2 wild = invalid)
- [ ] A‚ô†-A‚ô•-A‚ô£-2‚ô† (3 natural + 1 wild = valid)

### **Deadlock Testing**

- [ ] Player trying to baixar all cards without bater requirements

### **Multi-Round Testing**
- [ ] Team reaches 1500, check 75+ requirement next round
- [ ] Someone bates with 3000+, check victory
- [ ] Hand card swapping calculation
