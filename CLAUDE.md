- **Input Component**: Mobile-optimized with keyboard handling
- **Modal System**: Responsive dialogs with mobile-friendly animations  
- **Card Components**: Mobile-first card display molecules
- **Layout System**: Responsive Grid/Layout components

#### Phase 3: GameTable Refactoring ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **ChatSystem**: Extracted as standalone organism with chatStore
- **UI Detection**: Responsive breakpoint system in uiStore

## Current Status üìä

### ‚úÖ WORKING CORRECTLY
- Mobile scrolling in game interface
- Card selection sends correct cards to server
- Basic baixar functionality (with validation bypass for testing)
- Responsive design across devices
- Modern UI components and animations

### üîß FOR TESTING ONLY
- **Sequence Validation**: Currently bypassed - allows invalid sequences like "2,3,9"
- **Server Logs**: Show bypass messages for debugging

### üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

- ‚úÖ **Host detection bug**: Fixed for game start functionality

## Architecture Notes
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **State Management**: Zustand stores (gameStore, uiStore, chatStore)  
- **Component Pattern**: Atomic Design (atoms ‚Üí molecules ‚Üí organisms)
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive breakpoints with touch optimization
- **WebSocket**: Real-time game communication via Socket.IO
