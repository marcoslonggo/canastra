## Canastra Game Rules (Key Points)
- **Objective**: First team to 5,000 points wins
- **Cards**: Two 52-card decks + 4 Jokers (108 cards total)
- **Dealing**: 11 cards per player (15 in some variants)
- **Melds**: 3+ cards of same rank, Canastas are 7+ card melds
- **Wild Cards**: 2s and Jokers (more natural cards than wild in melds)
- **Scoring**: Various point values, bonuses for Canastas
- **Going Out**: Need at least one Canasta to go out

## Game State Management
```typescript
interface GameState {
  id: string;
  players: Player[];
  currentTurn: number;
  deck: Card[];
  discardPile: Card[];
  teamMelds: [Meld[], Meld[]];
  scores: [number, number];
  phase: 'waiting' | 'playing' | 'finished';
}

// In-memory storage on server
const activeGames = new Map<string, GameState>();
const waitingPlayers = new Map<string, Player>();
```

## Features for Family Play
- **Simple registration**: Just username/password
- **Private room codes**: Easy sharing (e.g., "FAMILY123")
- **Lobby chat**: General and game-specific chat
- **Game history**: Track family victories and stats
- **Mobile responsive**: Works on phones, tablets, computers
- **Family-friendly UI**: Large buttons, clear text, simple navigation

## Chat System Design
- **Lobby chat**: All users can chat while waiting
- **Game chat**: Private chat within game rooms
- **Basic moderation**: Family-friendly filters
- **WebSocket events**: `chat:lobby`, `chat:game`, `chat:message`

## Mobile Considerations
- **Touch-friendly**: Large tap targets
- **Responsive layouts**: Mobile-first CSS Grid
- **Future mobile app**: Architecture supports React Native later
- **Offline resilience**: Handle network drops gracefully

## Key WebSocket Events
```typescript
// Client -> Server
'auth:login', 'game:join', 'game:draw', 'game:meld', 'game:discard'
'chat:lobby', 'chat:game'

// Server -> Client  
'game:state-update', 'game:turn-change', 'game:end'
'chat:message', 'lobby:update'
```
